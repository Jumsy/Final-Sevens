Final Sevens

Dependancies:
 Python 2.7.2
 Pygame 1.9.1

To run:
 Type 'python Final-Sevens.py' on the command line.
 
 For information on arguments use 'python Final-Sevens.py -h'

In this game numbered blocks fall one at a time from the top of the screen.
When three blocks in a row/column add up to 7 or 21, they are destroyed and
the player's score increases. The game ends when the block spawner becomes
blocked.

BUGS
 * Some values for the screen size can cause errors later in the program
   It seems that the problem is caused when the y value is too small
   relative to the x value. I should find out how small is 'too small'
   and see why this error wasn't caught earlier.

TODO
 *I could rewrite the program to avoid the use of sys.exit() and totally
  remove the sys import.

FEATURES
 *3 modes of block color:
   Normal (easy) mode - blocks have basic colors
   Hard mode - blocks are all white
   Random mode - blocks are all given random colors
 *Reset blocks during the game to restart (also resets score)
 *Changeable screen size
