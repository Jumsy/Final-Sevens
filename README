Final Sevens

Dependancies:
 Python 2.7.2
 Pygame 1.9.1

To run:
 Type 'python Final-Sevens.py' on the command line.

In this game numbered blocks fall one at a time from the top of the screen.
When three blocks in a row/column add up to 7 or 21, they are destroyed and
the player's score increases. The game ends when the block spawner becomes
blocked.

BUGS

TODO
 *Remove Score from the pause screen at add in on the right-side menu
 *Modify curBlock so that it is a cluster of blocks. It should work the
  same as it does currently.
 *Write an improved class to handle colors. The class should have
  functions for randomizing colors, resetting colors, etc.
 *The lines in the background should be more subtle
 *I could rewrite the program to avoid the use of sys.exit() and totally
  remove the sys import.

FEATURES
 *3 modes of block color:
   Normal (easy) mode - blocks have basic colors
   Hard mode - blocks are all white
   Random mode - blocks are all given random colors
 *Reset blocks during the game to restart (also resets score)
