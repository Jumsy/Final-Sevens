Dependancies:

In this game numbered blocks fall one at a time from the top of the screen.
When three blocks in a row/column add up to 7 or 21, they are destroyed and
the player's score increases. The game ends when the block spawner becomes
blocked.

BUGS

TODO
 *Refactor
 *Add a spot on the right-side menu for displaying the next shape
 *Clean up the pause screen function
 *Remove Score from the pause screen at add in on the right-side menu
 *I could rewrite the program to avoid the use of sys.exit() and totally
  remove the sys import.
 *Have variable difficulty where the number blocks have to add up to is
  increased. Also increase the numbers on blocks spawned

FEATURES
 *3 modes of block color:
   Normal (easy) mode - blocks have basic colors
   Hard mode - blocks are all white
   Random mode - blocks are all given random colors
 *Reset blocks during the game to restart (also resets score)
