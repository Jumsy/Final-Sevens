Final Sevens

Dependancies:
 Python 2.7.2
 Pygame 1.9.1

To run:
 Type 'python Final-Sevens.py' on the command line. 

 'python Final-Sevens.py width height' also works where
 width and height must given as integers like 400 500'

In this game numbered blocks fall one at a time from the top of the screen.
When three blocks in a row/column add up to 7 or 21, they are destroyed and
the player's score increases. The game ends when the block spawner becomes
blocked.

BUGS
 *If the spawner is blocked for a moment by blocks that add up to 7 or 21
  game will still end despite those blocks being taken away.
 *If window height is smaller than the width the large block size throws
  things off.

FEATURES
 *3 modes of block color:
   Normal (easy) mode - blocks have basic colors
   Hard mode - blocks are all white
   Random mode - blocks are all given random colors
 *Reset blocks during the game to restart (also resets score)
 *Changeable screen size
