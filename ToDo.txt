I'd like for the screen size to be modifiable. There are magic numbers strewn throughout this program which need to be taken care of first.

Initially, the changed screen size would just change the size of each row/column, but eventually I'd like it if the increased screen size actually affected the number of rows/columns and not just their size.

Make blockSize all capitals because it's a constant.
 Look out for other constants too.

Capital letters aren't acknowledged. If I have in the event loop something like:
 if event.key == ord('Q'):, it won't be caught for some reason. Once I get this
 fixed I'd like to have it so you can quit outside of the pause screen, but
 only if you push Q. People may quit accidentally if you can quit on q.
 *It looks like this is because pygame might separately acknowledge shift
  and the q button. Using caps lock didn't work either. I'm going to have to
  look this up online whenever it's important enough to me.

The initial spawning block always comes from the left. I think that this might
 be a problem with one of the first blocks getting to the end of their track
 before the other one, but I'm not sure.

A potential re-write I'm thinking of is to add on another value to all the
 blocks in addition to number, rect, and number rect. That value would be
 direction. This way I could add all the blocks to one list similarly to what
 I tried to do with printing the blocks and just go over the whole thing with
 one function. One problem with this approach is when topBlocks move laterally
 they move 4 points over while curBlock would move one block length over.

 Fixing this should make everything a lot simpler once I get past that hang-up
