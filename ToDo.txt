I'd like for the screen size to be modifiable. There are magic numbers strewn throughout this program which need to be taken care of first.

Initially, the changed screen size would just change the size of each row/column, but eventually I'd like it if the increased screen size actually affected the number of rows/columns and not just their size.

Make blockSize all capitals because it's a constant.
 Look out for other constants too.

Capital letters aren't acknowledged. If I have in the event loop something like:
 if event.key == ord('Q'):, it won't be caught for some reason. Once I get this
 fixed I'd like to have it so you can quit outside of the pause screen, but
 only if you push Q. People may quit accidentally if you can quit on q also here
